# Docker File: 
  I tried opening docker desktop for the practical, but it was continuously showing error (attached in the folder). Still worte    the command.
# Podman:
  After installing the podman,  for running it, used the command:
  podman machine init and then podman machine start.
  after that, to open it on the specific host, used the port no. 8081.
